# iOS Agent MCP

## One install, one MCP connection (2.5.1)

```bash
claude mcp add ios-agent -- npx -y ios-agent-mcp@2.5.1
```

The default server exposes 34 tools: 11 Swift reviews, 8 Apple reference tools, 14 simulator tools, and `create_app`. App scaffolding and simulator packages install automatically as dependencies; no separate installation or MCP connection is needed. Remove the separate knowledge/simulator connections if you previously configured them to avoid duplicate tools.

Create a starter directly:

```bash
npx -y ios-agent-mcp@2.5.1 new MyApp --brief "A reading list with local storage" --xcodegen
```

Requires Node.js 20+. Simulator operations require macOS and Xcode; XcodeGen is required to generate an Xcode project from the starter specification. The agent implements app features using the starter, source tools and verification tools. One install is not autonomous app generation. The default connection now includes tools that write files and operate the simulator; review and reference tools remain read-only.

# Local source retrieval in 2.4.0

The knowledge server now searches bundled repository source, templates and guides, outlines sections, and reads exact content with bounded output and continuation offsets. It exposes eight knowledge tools separately from the eleven analyzer tools. No runtime browsing is needed for local source retrieval. See [offline source workflow](../docs/tooling/offline-source-library.md).

## New in 2.4.0: Apple knowledge tools for more clients

This package includes two MCP binaries: `ios-agent-mcp` for local Swift project analysis and `ios-agent-knowledge` for public Apple references and app/icon planning. Claude, Codex and Gemini CLI can run either over stdio. The knowledge server also supports Streamable HTTP for a hosted ChatGPT connection.

```bash
npx -y --package=ios-agent-mcp@2.4.0 ios-agent-knowledge
```

Knowledge tools search 405 technologies and 96 update/release-note sources, retrieve guides, plan an app implementation, and specify separate Icon Composer layers. They do not write apps, access arbitrary project paths or claim native icon generation. [Setup](https://github.com/Nagarjuna2997/ios-agent-skill/blob/main/docs/mcp/installation.md).

# ios-agent-mcp

An MCP server that reviews Swift projects against the rules in
[ios-agent-skill](https://github.com/Nagarjuna2997/ios-agent-skill).

The skill teaches an agent how to *write* iOS code. This server lets an agent
*check* it — ten tools that read a Swift project and report defects with a file,
a line, the consequence, and the fix, plus one that lints a skill repository's
own metadata.

```
You:  Review my Swift project for concurrency problems.

Claude → review_swift_concurrency

🔴 Sources/FeedModel.swift:3 — @Observable type is not @MainActor-isolated.
   Why: @Observable grants no isolation. SwiftUI reads this state during layout
        while any task may write it — a data race under Swift 5 mode, a compile
        error under Swift 6.
   Fix: Annotate the type: `@MainActor @Observable final class …`
```

## Tools

| Tool | Finds |
|------|-------|
| `analyze_swift_project` | Structure — file counts, deployment target, frameworks, tests — plus finding counts per category. **Start here.** |
| `review_swift_concurrency` | `@Observable` without `@MainActor`, `Task.detached`, `DispatchQueue.main.async`, `@unchecked Sendable`, `nonisolated(unsafe)`, unstructured `Task` in `onAppear`, empty `catch`, a type named `Task` |
| `review_swift_architecture` | Live-implementation default arguments, presentation naming `URLSession`/`APIClient`/`ModelContext`, singletons in view models, domain importing SwiftUI, nested `NavigationStack`, `NavigationView` |
| `review_swiftui` | Fixed font sizes and heights, `AnyView`, `.cornerRadius`, literal spacing, materials over solid backgrounds, view state on models, `ObservableObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`, `try!` |
| `check_availability_guards` | Missing guards, **over-restrictive guards** (an iOS 26 API guarded at iOS 27 silently drops every iOS 26 device), Foundation Models without a runtime availability check |
| `audit_app_store_readiness` | Permission frameworks with no Info.plist purpose string, missing `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, unlocalized strings, unlabeled icon buttons, `print()` |
| `review_swift_memory` | Repeating `Timer` and `NotificationCenter` blocks capturing self, Combine sinks, non-`weak` delegates, stored closures, `unowned self` |
| `review_swift_security` | Hardcoded secrets, credentials in `UserDefaults`, disabled ATS, cleartext HTTP, TLS trust accepted without evaluation, MD5/SHA-1, Keychain accessibility |
| `review_swift_testing` | **Test files only.** Sleeping, tests with no assertion, live `URLSession`, `await` in an `XCTAssert` autoclosure, order-dependent static state |
| `review_swift_performance` | Formatters and collection work inside `body`, `ForEach` over indices, eager stacks in a `ScrollView`, blocking I/O on the render path |
| `lint_skill` | **Skill metadata, not Swift.** `SKILL.md` frontmatter, subagent `name`/filename mismatches, misspelled tool names, **read-only agents granted `Edit` or `Write`**, mirror files drifted from `SKILL.md`, broken doc references |

Every tool takes one argument:

```json
{ "path": "/absolute/path/to/your/project" }
```

The first ten want a Swift project root. `lint_skill` wants an Agent Skill
repository root — the folder containing `SKILL.md`.

Every review tool also returns `structuredContent` — typed data with `summary`,
`score`, `counts`, `files_checked`, `issues`, and `suggestions` — alongside the
markdown, so a workflow can branch on a result without regexing prose.

---

## Resources

Tools are verbs the model chooses to call. Resources are nouns a client can read
without being asked, so a project's shape can be attached to context up front.

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ios-agent": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ios-agent-mcp", "--project", "/absolute/path/to/project"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Resource | Contains |
|---|---|
| `ios://project/info` | Counts, deployment target, UI framework, inferred architecture **with its evidence**, DI detection, frameworks |
| `ios://project/dependencies` | Third-party packages from `Package.swift` / `Package.resolved` / `Podfile`, plus Apple frameworks |
| `ios://project/issues` | Every finding across all nine categories, with counts by severity and category |

The root comes from `--project`, then `IOS_AGENT_PROJECT`, then the working
directory the client spawned the server in. **Every payload reports which root it
used**, so an empty project is never mistaken for a wrong path.

Project resources remain read-only snapshots. Build, test and simulator actions are available as tools in the unified connection; they require macOS/Xcode.

---

## What it does and does not do

**Review tools:** read project files without modifying them. **App creation:** writes a new starter. **Simulator tools:** build/test projects and operate devices; builds can fetch dependencies, and preview starts a loopback server.

**Does not:** prove your app builds or behaves correctly. Run `swift build` and
`swift test` for that — the tools say so in their own output.

Findings are graded so you can triage:

| | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🔴 **blocker** | Crashes, data races, or App Review rejection |
| 🟠 **serious** | Real defect — untestable code, accessibility failure, deprecated API |
| 🟡 **minor** | Maintainability and consistency |

Test, mock, stub, and preview files are exempt from the app-code-only rules, and
`Package.swift` is skipped — they legitimately do things app code must not.

---

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # tsc
npm test             # 123 tests: unit + end-to-end over real MCP stdio
npm run typecheck
```

Analyzers are pure functions of `(path, content) → Finding[]`, so they are
tested without the MCP transport. `test/server.smoke.test.js` launches the real
server and speaks the real protocol, because unit tests cannot tell you whether
the server actually starts.

To add a rule: write the analyzer, then a test that **fails without the rule**.
A test that passes either way is not a test.

---

## Publishing (maintainers)

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install          # REQUIRED FIRST — see below
npm login
npm publish
```

**`npm install` is not optional.** `prepublishOnly` runs `npm run build && npm test`, and `build` is `tsc`. On a fresh clone there is no `node_modules`, so the compiler is not present and publish fails with:

```
error TS2591: Cannot find name 'node:fs/promises'. Do you need to install
type definitions for node? Try `npm i --save-dev @types/node`
```

That is the guard working as intended — it refuses to publish an unbuilt package — but the fix is `npm install`, not disabling the hook.

After publishing, verify:

```bash
npm view ios-agent-mcp version     # registry has it
npx -y ios-agent-mcp --version     # 2.1.0
npx -y ios-agent-mcp --help        # usage, tool list, setup commands
```

`--help` and `--version` print and exit. Every other invocation starts the
stdio server and blocks waiting for a client, which is correct but looks like a
hang if you run it by hand.

To see exactly what would ship before committing to it:

```bash
npm pack --dry-run
```

Expect ~31 files: `dist/`, `mcp.json`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `package.json`. If `dist/` is missing, the build did not run.

### Version numbering

The npm package version and the repository version are **independent**:

| | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `ios-agent-mcp` on npm | `2.1.0` | Generated from `package.json` — see below |
| `ios-agent-skill` repo / `SKILL.md` | `2.1.0` | Kept in lockstep since 2.1.0 |

**The version lives in `package.json` and nowhere else.** `mcp.json`,
`package-lock.json`, the CLI, and the MCP handshake are all generated from it by
`npm run sync-version`, which `build` and `typecheck` run automatically.

This exists because **2.0.1 shipped to npm with an `mcp.json` declaring
`1.0.0`** — the version was maintained by hand in four places, so one was always
wrong and nothing checked. CI runs `sync-version --check`, so a hand-edit fails
the build rather than reaching the registry.

Since 2.1.0 the skill and the server share a version. They were independent
before, which is exactly how 2.0.1 shipped with a manifest reading 1.0.0.

# xcselect

## Context

Load this when a task names **xcselect** or one of the API topics below.

Apple categories: Developer Tools.

[Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcselect) · Source checked: 2026-09-10.

Apple’s short description (excerpt):

> Access the path of the macOS SDK available on the host system.

## Pattern

Use the topic map below to select the API for the requested feature. Follow the [technology implementation workflow](../technology-workflow.md) before writing integration code.

Documented modules: `xcselect`.

Documentation language identifiers: occ, swift.

### Availability from the landing page

| Platform | Introduced | Deprecated | Beta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mac Catalyst | 13.0 | — | No |
| macOS | 10.15 | — | No |

These are landing-page values, not availability guarantees for every member. Check the selected symbol and the installed SDK.

The landing page exposes no topic groups in the retrieved DocC representation. Use its canonical source for the current navigation.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not infer iOS support from membership in this directory; it also includes macOS, drivers, web services, tools, and legacy APIs.
- Do not treat this source-checked topic map as a compiled implementation or assume every member is available on the landing page’s minimum OS.
- Do not copy a similarly named framework’s setup. Select the exact symbol, language, target type, and entitlement requirements from its source.

### Availability from the landing page

| Platform | Introduced | Deprecated | Beta |
|---|---|---|---|
| iOS | 15.0 | — | No |
| iPadOS | 15.0 | — | No |
| Mac Catalyst | 15.0 | — | No |

These are landing-page values, not availability guarantees for every member. Check the selected symbol and the installed SDK.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not infer iOS support from membership in this directory; it also includes macOS, drivers, web services, tools, and legacy APIs.
- Do not treat this source-checked topic map as a compiled implementation or assume every member is available on the landing page’s minimum OS.
- Do not copy a similarly named framework’s setup. Select the exact symbol, language, target type, and entitlement requirements from its source.

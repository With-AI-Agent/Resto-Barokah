# Collaboration

## Context

Load this when a task names **Collaboration** or one of the API topics below.

Apple categories: System.

[Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/collaboration) · Source checked: 2026-09-10.

Apple’s short description (excerpt):

> Find and access identities, that is, users and groups. Display the Identity Picker, which lets users create and select identities.

## Pattern

Use the topic map below to select the API for the requested feature. Follow the [technology implementation workflow](../technology-workflow.md) before writing integration code.

Documented modules: `Collaboration`.

Documentation language identifiers: occ, swift.

### Availability from the landing page

| Platform | Introduced | Deprecated | Beta |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | 10.5 | — | No |

These are landing-page values, not availability guarantees for every member. Check the selected symbol and the installed SDK.

### Classes

- [CBGroupIdentity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/collaboration/cbgroupidentity)
- [CBIdentity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/collaboration/cbidentity)
- [CBIdentityAuthority](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/collaboration/cbidentityauthority)
- [CBIdentityPicker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/collaboration/cbidentitypicker)
- [CBUserIdentity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/collaboration/cbuseridentity)

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not infer iOS support from membership in this directory; it also includes macOS, drivers, web services, tools, and legacy APIs.
- Do not treat this source-checked topic map as a compiled implementation or assume every member is available on the landing page’s minimum OS.
- Do not copy a similarly named framework’s setup. Select the exact symbol, language, target type, and entitlement requirements from its source.

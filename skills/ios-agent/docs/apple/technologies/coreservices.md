## Anti-Patterns

- Do not infer iOS support from membership in this directory; it also includes macOS, drivers, web services, tools, and legacy APIs.
- Do not treat this source-checked topic map as a compiled implementation or assume every member is available on the landing page’s minimum OS.
- Do not copy a similarly named framework’s setup. Select the exact symbol, language, target type, and entitlement requirements from its source.

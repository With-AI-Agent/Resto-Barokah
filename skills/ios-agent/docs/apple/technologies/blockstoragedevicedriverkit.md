### Availability from the landing page

| Platform | Introduced | Deprecated | Beta |
|---|---|---|---|
| DriverKit | 21.0 | — | No |

These are landing-page values, not availability guarantees for every member. Check the selected symbol and the installed SDK.

### Essentials

- [com.apple.developer.driverkit.family.block-storage-device](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.driverkit.family.block-storage-device)

### Driver Interfaces

- [IOUserBlockStorageDevice](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/blockstoragedevicedriverkit/iouserblockstoragedevice)

### Macros

- [kMaxDeviceStringLength](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/blockstoragedevicedriverkit/kmaxdevicestringlength)

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not infer iOS support from membership in this directory; it also includes macOS, drivers, web services, tools, and legacy APIs.
- Do not treat this source-checked topic map as a compiled implementation or assume every member is available on the landing page’s minimum OS.
- Do not copy a similarly named framework’s setup. Select the exact symbol, language, target type, and entitlement requirements from its source.
